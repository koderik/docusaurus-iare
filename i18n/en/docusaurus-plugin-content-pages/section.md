# Chapter

How does the chapter work?

The purpose of the chapter  
The chapter is a non-profit organization with the official name "Royal chapter for Industrial Economics", which is often abbreviated to I-chapter. The purpose of the chapter is to promote the studies of I-ers and all student life related to the studies. In other words, the I-chapter is a group of students with the common interest to make their time studying Industrial Management at KTH the best years of their lives!

The chapter and its offer
The exercise and concentration of common interests takes place mainly through committees that run various activities within the chapter. Two examples are iFokus - a committee for members who like photography, and Clubmästeriet (CMi) - a committee for people who like to organize pubs and parties. All our committees can be found under the "Committees" tab in the menu above. As a member of the I-chapter you can apply for committees and hopefully get involved. Many activities and events take place within committees, so all interested parties are encouraged to apply for committees that they find exciting! However, there are also open events that all members can attend that are organized by different committees. To attend open events such as events within committees, you must have a valid membership in THS.

A part of THS
The I-chapter is part of THS (Tekniska Högskolans Studentkår) which helps to coordinate all chapters and associations at KTH. As part of THS, we get access to common resources, such as financial contributions and booking of premises at a favorable price (in Nymble).


Chapter member
A chapter member is a person who studies Industrial Economics at KTH and who has a valid membership in THS (i.e. has paid their membership fee for a given academic year). Members of our chapter are referred to as I-ers.


Chapter resources
The chapter's committees and members may use the chapter's common resources to run their activities. The resources are material as well as financial. Our material assets consist mainly of: The chapter premises, Istället. Abbreviated to Issy. All properties in Istället and the stores in the premises. The chapter car, now called Ivan.

Statutes and Regulations
As an association, the I-chapter has Statutes that determine how the chapter's activities should be conducted. In addition to the Bylaws, the chapter also has a Regulation and Policy document that determines in greater detail how the chapter, the committees, and the Board should function. *For further information, it is recommended to read through the Statutes and Regulations, which can be found under the tab "File archive" in the menu above.


The chapter meeting
The Chapter Meeting, usually abbreviated SM(Sektions Möte in swedish), is the highest decision-making body of the I-chapter. Changes in the Statutes and Regulations, decisions about the future of the chapter, and so on, are decided by the SM. All chapter members have the right to attend the SM and influence what is to be discussed. This is mainly done through Motions. A motion is a request for the chapter to do something or change the Statutes and Regulations, which in turn changes the activities of the chapter. *Under the tab "File archive" in the menu above there is a template for a motion.* If you have any questions or need help on how to submit a motion, please contact the Vice President at vice@iare.nu.

Board of Directors
The Board is the chapter's executive unit and works both strategically and operationally. The board executes the decisions made by the SM, but also works to improve the chapter with its own projects. The operational work consists mainly of coordinating the chapter's resources among its committees. A description of what each board member is responsible for can be found in the Regulations.
