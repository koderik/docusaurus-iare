# For companies

Does your company want to get in touch with I-students? We offer many opportunities for collaboration, below we list our most common ways of contact/event, but we are happy to come up with new ideas together with you!

### Lunchtime lecture
The lunchtime lectures are usually highly appreciated by the students. You hold a presentation during lunch (12:15-13:00) for about 50-80 students while they eat a simple lunch. What you want to talk about during the lecture is entirely up to you and you can also choose the type of food served. At the lunch lecture, you can, for example, present the company, what a normal day looks like or talk about open positions. If you want to know more, contact the event group at event.naringsliv@iare.nu.

### Advertising
A very good way to reach out to many students is to advertise on our social media. We offer ads in Sektionsengagemang f√∂r Industriell Ekonomi with over 2000 members, mailings to specific year courses or ads here on the website. Contact the Business Council at naringsliv@iare.nu

### Dagen I
Dagen I is the Industrial Economics section's own labor market day. During the labor market days, a number of events such as breakfast and lunch lectures and workshops are held both at KTH Campus and on site at the companies. The labor market days end with a fair and a festive banquet for both company representatives and I-students.

Contact: If you are interested in knowing more about Dagen I, you can either visit www.dageni.se, contact the project manager at projektledare@dageni.se or the business manager at naringsliv@dageni.se.

### I-Case
This board focuses on case events, both in the form of internal case evenings and company events. Company events can take several different forms, most commonly they are held at the company's office, but it is also possible to hold them in KTH's premises. The committee consists of two parts, I-Case Aspire which is the younger group and I-Case advanced which is the more experienced group. The events are held in the evening (about 17:30-21) and always end with dinner together with the company. Contact us at i-case@iare.nu.

### I-Start
iStart is a committee that focuses on promoting innovation and knowledge about self-employment for the students in the section. We therefore target companies in the startup phase to medium-sized companies, and welcome them to various types of collaborations such as workshops, lunch lectures, evening events and study visits etc. where you get the opportunity to meet the students and promote knowledge both about your company but also our board's core focus of entrepreneurship, innovation and the road to starting your own business. If you are interested in cooperation, please contact us at istart@iare.nu.
