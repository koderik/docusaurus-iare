Well-being

Well-being is a high priority for the I-Chapter. We have various support for well-being in the form of a safety council (contact skyddsombud@iare.nu) for incidents related to chapter involvement, support from KTH student health and this page for stress management. We know that study time can be stressful for many, especially during exam periods. Therefore, in contact with researchers at Karolinska Institutet and Ume√• University, we have provided the following tips for managing stress. The idea is that these tips should be followed in order from first to last, e.g. one tip a day to allow it to sink in. Once you have gone through all the tips, you can look at today's tips to repeat them.
