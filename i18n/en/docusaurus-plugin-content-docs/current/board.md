# Board of Directors

The chapter is led by the board, which consists of 10 members elected by the chapter meeting. The board is, in addition to the chapter meeting, the chapter's highest decision-making body with responsibility for the chapter's activities and finances.

The board is the face of our chapter and we therefore have a lot of contact with our student union THS, the ITM school that is responsible for our program, KTH and other schools around Sweden.

The board meets several times a week and officially meets five times a year. Our meetings are open to everyone and chapter members are welcome to attend or raise issues with us.
