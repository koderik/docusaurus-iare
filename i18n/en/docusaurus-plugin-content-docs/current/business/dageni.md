# Dagen-I
Dagen I is the Industrial Economics chapter's own labor market day. The organization is a committee
within the chapter since 2011 to give students from the civil engineering program and the master program in
Industrial Management the opportunity to meet companies and different employers. This gives "I-students"
the opportunity to build valuable relationships for the future. It is also the place where companies have
opportunity to reach out and meet top students from the I program.

During the labor market days, a number of events are held such as breakfast and lunch lectures as well as
workshops both on the KTH Campus and on site at the companies. The labor market days end with a
fair and a festive banquet for both company representatives and I-students.

Our ambition is to create a career fair in English with a wide range of exhibiting companies that well
represent the future labor market that awaits our students and exchange students after graduation.
