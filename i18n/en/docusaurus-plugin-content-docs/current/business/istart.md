# iStart

### What is iStart?

Stockholm produces the second highest number of unicorn companies (startups with a value of at least one billion dollars) per capita after Silicon Valley, according to the OECD. This makes Stockholm one of the world's top places to explore if you are interested in entrepreneurship and innovation!

iStart gives students a direct insight into the entrepreneurial world of Stockholm. Together we organize events where the chapter is given the opportunity to meet startups, investors, mentors and other relevant actors in the field. We also meet students in similar associations from other universities in Sweden and abroad.

Here, the chapter's members get the opportunity to talk to each other and relevant actors about entrepreneurship and innovation, and find channels to build on their interest. We are the bridge between just being curious about the area and contacting, for example, KTH Innovation to really try to develop an idea.

### Organization

It is important for us as a relatively small board with 20 members that there is a good and wonderful atmosphere. We recruit you who are committed and want to be part of a community where we istart friends run projects together.

Feel free to send an email or call if you want to hear more or are interested in joining iStart.
