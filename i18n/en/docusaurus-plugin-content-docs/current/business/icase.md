# I-Case

### What is I-Case?

I-Case is an attractive recruitment platform for the Stockholm business community. The board's purpose is best described as a bridge between Stockholm's business community and the I-Case students. As a member of I-Case, you get to develop your skills in case solving while visiting a variety of companies during the year that are interested in recruiting you!

### Activities

As one of the board's 70 members, you will be invited to several events during the academic year at different companies. The structure of a case evening can vary, but in general it usually goes as follows:

+ Case solution in group, you get a business case to be solved and presented.
+ Presentation of the completed case - valuable feedback from company representatives.
+ Dinner and mingle with company representatives
+ I-Case is here for everyone (regardless of academic age) and also offers training in basic economic models and approaches as well as case-oriented presentation techniques! Towards the end of the year, the case competition I-Case Challenge is organized where I-students from KTH, LTH, LTU, CTH and LiTH compete against each other.

### Organization

I-Case as an organization consists of a board that works hard to connect students at the I-chapter to potential future employers. We always recruit the first place to secure the board's future. As a member, no voluntary work is required, but the requirements for a member are presence at the events, a cheerful mood and curiosity!
