# NLN

### What is NLN?

Näringslivsnämnden, often called NLN, is the link between the chapter and the business community. Communication channels such as email, facebook, intranet as well as company events are in focus when we work to create as good a contact area between the students at the I-chapter and the business community as possible. Through solid relationship building with the business community's various companies, we work for long and rewarding relationships to provide students with useful information for future opportunities.

### Activities

The board's work largely involves meetings with various representatives from the business community to help them develop and form collaborations with the Division of Industrial Economics.

Collaborations result in various events intended for the students that are arranged by either the company itself or by NLN's event group. Examples of events that NLN organizes during the year are lunch lectures, dinners with companies, other fun student activities with the companies and simpler everyday marketing.

### Organization

The committee consists of 30-40 students who are passionate about creating a good collaboration with the business community. This is so that the members of the chapter will ultimately get their dream job and/or internship. NLN is divided into two groups, with a chairman who helps and supervises the two groups in their work. One is the company group, which takes care of the day-to-day contact. The other is the event group, which administers and carries out all events organized by the NLN.
