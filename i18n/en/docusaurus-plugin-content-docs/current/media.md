# Communications Committee

KMN consists of four groups that ensure that the chapter's communication and public face is as we want it to be. The first group is I-Focus, which photographs at events and does graphic design to preserve all the fun memories we create in the chapter. The second group, I-T, maintains and updates the chapter's websites to facilitate chapter activity and provide easy access to important information. I-Nstagram is the third group and makes posts on social media so that the chapter can reach out to both chapter members and externally outside the chapter. Finally, the fourth group, I-Press, is responsible for the creation and launch of the chapter's own newspaper where committees and individual chapter members can write articles.
