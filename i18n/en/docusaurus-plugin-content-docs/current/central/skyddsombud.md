# Safety representative

According to the Work Environment Act, each chapter must have a student safety representative, whose task is to represent and advocate for the students in the chapter. The safety representative is appointed by the students in the chapter.

A student safety representative has the same rights and obligations as an employee safety representative except for the right to stop work. One of those obligations includes confidentiality. Thus, the safety representative may not without consent pass on what they have learned during the assignment (AML chapter 7 ยง 13). In chapter I, the Safety Officer is also one of the members of the Safety Council.

You can turn to the Safety Representative if you want to report incidents, both in the physical (for example, the chapter room or other premises on campus) and the psychosocial work environment (for example, teachers who do not behave fairly, violations or sexual abuse), if you have questions about the safety and well-being work at the chapter or if you simply want someone to talk to.
