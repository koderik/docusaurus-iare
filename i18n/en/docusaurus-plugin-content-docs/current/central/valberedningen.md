# Election Committee

The Election Committee
The chapter's Election Committee consists of three to seven elected members, of which one is the elected President and one seat is reserved for Ettan. The task of the election committee is to promote and manage the election process of all elected positions in the chapter before and during each chapter meeting. In practice, the election process is as follows:

The election committee opens the application period.
Interested candidates apply and are then interviewed by the Election Committee.
Once the Committee has interviewed all the candidates for a particular post, it produces a preamble, or recommendation, which is simply a justification of which candidate it considers most suitable for the post.
The electoral committee moderates the elections during the associated chapter meeting where all candidates can give speeches and are then elected by the chapter members who attend. It is also possible to run for a position on the spot.
The Election Committee takes great care to maintain the integrity of all applicants and to make the process as impartial and equal for all as possible. Nomination Committee interviews are designed to prepare the candidate for the SM and is a chance to brainstorm ideas for their speech and ask questions. The Election Committee uses the interview as a basis for compiling a list of candidates for each position - a very difficult task as all the applicant chapter members of the I-chapter are usually highly suitable - and it is worth pointing out that it is the chapter that ultimately chooses the elected representative and the Election Committee therefore encourages all candidates to continue their candidacy regardless of who was nominated.
