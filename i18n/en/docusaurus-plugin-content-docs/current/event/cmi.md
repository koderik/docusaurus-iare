# ClubMästeriet

### What is ClubMästeriet?

Clubmästeriet, or CMi, organizes what most people would call the final light in the tunnel. We brighten up your everyday life and create moments that will be looked back on for a long time to come. Our business is a party. A party for the entire I-section.

### Activities

We organize sittings, tentaclubs, pubs and other hard-to-beat parties, which will put a golden edge on all section years. After the end of the reception, we have the honor of taking over the baton from the party group. As a CMi, you are responsible for the entire event. You stand behind the bar, choose the music, cook the food, fix the decor, mop the floor, arrive first and leave last. Partying with finesse is simply your thing!

### Organization

CMi consists of about thirty party-happy and lovely engineering students, who see the charm in organizing events for others and try to get an outlet for their lost bartender career. Between the section events, we also have time for the occasional internal party and soft hangout. There are many traditions that are cherished within CMi, while crazy ideas and new inventions are appreciated.

It is important to know that arranging meetings and pubs is at least as much fun as going there as a guest! As a CMi, you get a great opportunity to meet all the great people in the section. Start your years at KTH in the best possible way and create unique bonds for life.
