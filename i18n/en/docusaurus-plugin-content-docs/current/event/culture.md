# Culture Committee

## Activities

The Culture Committee consists of about forty I-ers who are passionate about organizing events and meetings with an undertone of culture. Even though the Culture Committee is one of the chapter's younger committees, we have already made a significant and lasting impression on the chapter's traditions and activities; the Subway Sitting, where I-ers in pairs are given the chance to have dinner with and at two other pairs of I-ers, is already a beloved classic, and during the Compass Sitting, which made a long-awaited comeback last year, the I-ers are given the chance to show an outsider how a real sitting on the I goes. In addition to this, other events, such as Midsummer Sitting, Cheese and Wine Tasting, as well as various pubs and fika, will be arranged. For the first time ever, we will also be the face of the I-chapter during Valborgspubrundan, and all this will of course be interspersed with a lot of fun internal events.

## Organisation

As a member of the Cultural Committee, you will be part of a tight project group where we together plan and implement fun events, with the goal of brightening each first-year's study time. In practical terms, this means contributing thoughts and ideas, standing at the bar, cooking, decorating, controlling the music, mixing drinks, and of course cleaning up afterwards! We are looking for someone who is committed, innovative, knows how to party with style and finesse, and likes to arrive first and leave last. Due to the committee's young age, there are also great opportunities to put one's own stamp on the committee. Perhaps you will be the only one to introduce the next great tradition to the chapter?

If, like us, you want to brighten up each first year's study time with exciting and innovative events, you've come to the right place! Hope to see you at our events during the year!
