# iSpexet


iSpexet is Industrial Economics' chapter spex and was formed in 1997. A spex is a student's form of theater filled to the brim with music, humor and audience interaction, or as we usually say: fun theater! From the beginning, iSpexet was a joke at the chapter's annual fine dining Porters Gasque but grew and got bigger every year. It is said that in the end the joke got too long so that no one could bear to listen and instead had to become their own show. Since 2001, the spex has been played every year in a real theatre. iSpex consists of several groups with responsibility for different areas; acting, choral singing, stage props, script writing, costumes, marketing and much more besides. Together, the roughly ten groups work continuously towards the winter's annual Christmas play and then towards the big highlight of the year: PORTERS SPEX, when iSpexet moves into a theater in Stockholm for a week. iSpexet organizes several different events during the year, including sit-ins (fixed by our own party group Qualas), walk-throughs, pubs and other fun!

If you like student life, community and above all if you like to have fun, then iSpexet is the group for you!

Spex director and committee manager 2023/2024 is Alma Gunnarsson, I-21. For more information about iSpexet, visit our Facebook page or www.ispexet.se.
