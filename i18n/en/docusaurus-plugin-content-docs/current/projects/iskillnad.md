# iSkillnad

iSkillnad is the chapter for Industrial Economics' committee with a focus on sustainability. Based on the Agenda 2030 goals, iSkillnad organizes various events during the year to draw attention to various sustainability issues. Our goal is to get more Iars involved in sustainability and to make it easier for the chapter as a whole to become more sustainable.
