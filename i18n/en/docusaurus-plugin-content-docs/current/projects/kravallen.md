# Kravallen

Imagine singing, music and dancing under a bright spring sky. Dazzling spotlights, confetti flying in the wind and a cold drink in hand on a dance floor full of happy students. The last time it happened in Maskinparken was in 2019, but those who wait for something good never wait too long. Kravallen is back!

Kravallen is organized by students from Industrial Economics at KTH and takes place in the Maskinparken on the KTH campus Valhallav√§gen for one evening.

Kravallen is a social event that unites Stockholm students and enriches Stockholm's student life. Joy and community among students is a central concept that Kravallen focuses on, as a large part of student life is otherwise concentrated at each individual university. Kravallen is a step in creating a common student life and thus making Stockholm a better and more enjoyable student city. The rally is created by students, for students, but everyone over 18 is welcome!
