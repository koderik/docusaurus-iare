# Board of Studies

### What is the Study Board?

The Study Board works to improve the I-program and strives to ensure that we students get the best possible education. We conduct course evaluations and have meetings with lecturers to develop the courses. The committee acts as a link between KTH and the class. We are here to help and answer study-related questions. At the same time, we arrange fun events, such as a programming pub where assistants help with the project in the first programming course and a coffee event to select the best lecturer and assistant of the year on the I-program.

All year groups are represented in the committee. At the weekly lunch meetings we have, in addition to lots of good coffee, an incredibly cozy atmosphere and great community.

If you have any study-related questions or want to know more about the committee, just get in touch!

Hugs to the Study Board
