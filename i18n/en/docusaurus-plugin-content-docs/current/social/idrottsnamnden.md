# Sports Council

The purpose of the Sports Council is to promote physical activity, health and fitness within the chapter. Just because you study at KTH does not mean that your life as an active and healthy person is over. Our goal is to connect the chapter with fun physical activities.

From poker nights and climbing for beginners, to a color-run where you can find the joy of running as well as throwing paint on others. The Sports Council should be there for as many people as possible and as often as possible. Our vision is to be the most active committee in the chapter. More continuous concepts such as our beloved paddle games but also weekly running for those who do not dare to venture out into the autumn darkness themselves .... should be mixed with larger events such as the ski trip.

In the future, the committee aims to consist of about 30 members. To give everyone the opportunity to develop on different fronts, the members have no fixed areas of responsibility within the committee. The team decides together how to approach the different events. In this case, a brand new member can be the leader for a certain event that he or she is particularly interested in, while in other cases it is advantageous to have previous experience.
