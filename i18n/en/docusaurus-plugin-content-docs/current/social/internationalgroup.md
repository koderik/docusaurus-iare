# International Group

### What is the International Group?

The International Group is a committee that aims to welcome international students to the I-chapter. We create contact between exchange students and I-ers. During the autumn and spring semesters you can apply to be a Buddy (sponsor in the International Reception) and thus participate in the events that are organized. The number of Buddies is recruited according to how many exchange students arrive. If you have been a Buddy for a semester and participated in the events organized, you can add 0.2 credits to your grade point average.

This year the board of the International Group consists of six people
