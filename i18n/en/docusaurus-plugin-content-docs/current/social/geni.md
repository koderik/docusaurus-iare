# GenI
### What is Geni?
GenI, short for "Genus on I", is the I chapter's JML committee and exists as a platform for discussion of JML issues. JML stands for gender equality, diversity and equal treatment, and GenI draws attention to and actively works on JML-related issues and inclusion, with the aim of making everyone feel welcome and safe to be themselves at the I-chapter. 

### Activities
By arranging fun and educational events for the whole chapter such as pubs, lectures and workshops, we want to raise awareness and knowledge about various JML-related topics in the chapter and contribute to an open and inclusive chapter culture. GenI also sends out an annual JML survey with the aim of mapping the current state of the chapter in order to work on making the chapter even better. 

If you want to work on JML issues, organize fun events and contribute to making the I-chapter an open and inclusive place, GenI is the committee for you!
