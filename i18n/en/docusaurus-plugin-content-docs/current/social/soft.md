# SOFt

### What is SOFt?

SOFt (chapter Official Fixer Team) is not an ordinary committee, but rather a tool for the chapter and is the committee that maintains and protects the chapter's assets. Our goal is to create a pleasant environment for everyone in the chapter! We do this primarily through maintenance of the chapter room Issy and the chapter car Volkis, but also different types of efforts to make the room a nicer place for all members by running creative projects and fixing things that need to be repaired or updated.

SOFt is the committee for those who are curious and open to solving problems and learning new things, while making sure that the chapter has a welcoming and pleasant place to gather!
