## What is I-Alumni?

I-Alumni is one of the chapter's younger committees and was established by transferring an already existing alumni network to the chapter. It is intended to serve as a link between Alumni, i.e. graduates of the I-program, and the students of the chapter. Through projects and events involving both professional alumni and students, the aim is to make use of the unique competence that the alumni possess, as well as the extensive experience of the education that exists among older students.

### Activities

The Board tries to organize a number of social events, at least one of which is a larger sitting open either to students together with alumni or exclusively to alumni from the alumni network.

The I-chapter's mentoring program will also be continued and pushed forward. It is aimed at students who are in their first year at KTH. They should be able to get a mentor from a higher year of the I program who, based on their own ability, can answer all possible questions about studies and the future, as well as act supportive and inspiring when studying is slow or when a friendly voice is needed.

In addition, the goal is to create and launch the I-chapter's own alumni podcast where knowledge from interested alumni can be disseminated and a greater insight into their professional life can be given, in an easily accessible way via mobile or similar.
